Additionally, refined the particle system and augmented post-processing effects for superior visual fidelity.
                    <br><br>In the course of developing this project, a paramount challenge was the accurate visualization of the game's meticulously designed atmosphere. To surmount this, I engaged in a close collaboration with the art director, focusing on elevating the lighting system. This collaborative effort led to the conceptualization and implementation of a novel shading technique, the Normal Ambient Light (NAL) system, which proved to be exceptionally effective for rendering outdoor scenes.
                    <br><br>Given the game's reliance on a dark, highly desaturated color palette, we dedicated substantial effort to refining shadow details. I lead major enhancements in Shadow Cascades and Point Light Shadows, achieving seamless integration with the game's environment. A pivotal advancement was the optimization of the Screen Space Ambient Occlusion filtering algorithm, significantly enhancing environmental realism.
                    <br><br>One of the project's crowning achievements was the development of Parallax Decals. This innovation was crucial for depicting highly realistic post-apocalyptic interiors, featuring volumetric dust, crumbling plaster, and rubble. Parts of this technology were also adeptly applied to simulate volumetric dirt on windows, further pushing the boundaries of realism."

                    <br><br>Over a year and a half into development, the project boasted over 2 million subscribers and consistently maintained about 1,000 active players online. This success can be attributed to the meticulously planned design and architecture, and the synergy of a highly dedicated team. As the team expanded to include specialized programmers for database management, UI, and game mechanics, I guided them towards achieving remarkable outcomes under my leadership.
                    <br><br>The engine's superior code quality allows it to operate efficiently across a broad spectrum of personal computers, with all systems optimized to perform only the necessary workload. My innovative approach in rendering decals, animating models, and managing bullet physics supported gameplay involving up to 30 players simultaneously on the same screen without performance drops.
